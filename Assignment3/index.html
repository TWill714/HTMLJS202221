    <p>     Hi I am Travis, I am an outgoing and creative person. As you can see I like the color purple and blue too much, and I am a big fan of galaxies. I love storytelling and gaming has been in my life since before I can remember. I grew up playing MMO's like <b><i>Club Penguin, Wizard101 and Animal Jam</i></b>. I adored the communities and as I grew up I started enjoying RPGs and <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/" target="_blank">horror games</a>. Now I like lots of story based games that play through chapters. I find it fascinating being able to tell a story that someone can change with their own choices.</p>
    <p>     I enrolled in New England Tech because I took a tour back in Sophomore year of highschool. I was IDM, and we worked in Unity, so my teacher had us take a tour of the school. I saw the game lab, and was excited to see the Mo-Cap sensors being used. I knew it was what I wanted to do, so it was the only school I applied for. I look forward to getting a degree in Game Design. I like Game Development, but because of my creative background and hyper imagination, I think I'll go into the design branch for my bachelor's degree.
